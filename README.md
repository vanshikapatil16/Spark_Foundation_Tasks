#### Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics <br> Internship Duration - 1 Month ( February-2023 ) <br> Internship Type - online Based



# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Please click on the images on right side to view my solution.

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?



# Task 2 : Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Task : From the given 'IRIS' dataset predict the optimal number of clusters and represents it visually



# Task 3 :Exploratory Data Analysis Retail-SuperStore
The task is :

(i) As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

(ii) What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? <br>
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)

(iii) Dash Boards - explaining the charts and interpretations.



# Task 5 : Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Sports
As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team. Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. StoryBoards - explaining the charts and interpretations. Use annotations, animation and images.

Observations The information depicted is of 9 seasons of IPL and a clear trend can be seen for the match winning combination of team members and the batting strengths. It was seen that Mumbai Indians played the most number of matches. Virat Kohli was the best batsman and has scored against some of the best bowlers The information shown for the opponents of Delhi Daredevils would include the bowlers against whom Virat performed poorly.

The top batsmen have been consistent in their performance.
Mumbai Indians have needed more games for each win while teams like CSK have needed less to win.



# Task 6 : Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

To predict the class of species used the following decision tree algorithms: 1. Decision Tree Classifier - Fully Grown 2. Decision Tree Classifier - With Optimal Depth 3. Decision Tree Classifier - Grid Search
